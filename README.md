# FroggerTangles
I'm upgrading my box-prototype-frogger to its own repo. It's frogger but made of rectangles. 

This is something of an attempt to create a rudimentary version of "Frogger" using nothing but rectangles in pygame. The rectangles aren't even surfaces, in fact. Everything's a rectangle and that's it.

The green square is supposed to be the frog. 

First I worked on then "lanes" which are just rectangles other rectangles can over lap. I had a first lane for various rows of traffic, then above that a "safe sidewalk". Above that I just the back ground color for water where thing like logs will be going and finally the "endzone" to provide the win condition.

I just about had the lanes position how I wanted when I decided to work on vehicles. After working on making a white rectangle move right/left and repeat for a long time, I decided to work on lanes again. 

And now, finally, I think I'm satisfied with how the lanes are positioning relative to each other.

So it's back to vehicles again. I when last I worked on them I had one moving left/right and repeating but moving right/left wouldn't work. Perhaps this time I'll succeed.
